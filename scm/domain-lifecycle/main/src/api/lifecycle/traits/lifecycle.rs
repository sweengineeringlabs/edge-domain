/// A state-machine abstraction for entities that transition through a typed
/// set of states.
///
/// `State` is deliberately left generic: the framework defines the substrate
/// (transition mechanics, error handling) while consumers supply the concrete
/// state type.  This keeps A2A `TaskState`, HTTP connection phases, saga
/// phases, and any other protocol-specific state space out of the framework.
///
/// The trait is `#[async_trait]`-decorated so it is object-safe and can be
/// used as `dyn Lifecycle<State = S>`.  Transitions are `async` to allow
/// implementations that emit lifecycle events, flush audit logs, or wait on
/// distributed locks before confirming a state change.
